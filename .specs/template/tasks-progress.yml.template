# Task Index - Lightweight tracking for all tasks
# Reference: Anthropic context engineering - "smallest set of high-signal tokens"
# This file provides a quick overview; detailed tracking is in each task's progress.yml

# === METADATA (Context Efficiency) ===
# High-signal summary updated automatically by commands
# Location: .specs/versions/{version}/tasks/progress.yml
metadata:
  format_version: "1.1"   # Version 1.1 with per-version tasks
  last_updated: null      # Auto-updated by /cspec:task and /cspec:complete
  total_tasks: 0          # Count of all tasks in this version
  active_tasks: 0         # Count of in_progress tasks
  completed_tasks: 0      # Count of completed tasks
  blocked_tasks: 0        # Count of blocked tasks

# === STATUS DEFINITIONS ===
# Reference: Claude 4 best practices - "explicit instructions with contextual motivation"
# WHY: Clear definitions prevent invalid state changes and help Claude make better decisions
status_definitions:
  pending: "Task defined but not started - awaiting dependencies or prioritization"
  in_progress: "Actively being worked on - check task's progress.yml for current state"
  blocked: "Cannot proceed - blocked_reason field explains why; resolve blocker to continue"
  completed: "All acceptance criteria met - completed timestamp set; folder kept for reference"

# === VALID STATUS TRANSITIONS ===
# WHY: Enforces correct workflow and prevents data corruption
valid_transitions:
  pending: ["in_progress", "blocked"]       # Can start work or hit blocker before starting
  in_progress: ["blocked", "completed"]     # Can finish or hit blocker during work
  blocked: ["pending", "in_progress"]       # Resolved blocker returns to previous state
  completed: []                              # Terminal state - no transitions allowed

# === TASKS ===
# Reference: Anthropic context engineering - "track dependencies across complex tasks"
# Sorted by: priority (high → medium → low), then creation date (newest first)
tasks:
  # === EXAMPLE TASK (Remove when creating your first real task) ===
  # Full example showing all fields including dependencies

  # - id: "001-user-authentication"
  #   name: "user-authentication"
  #
  #   # Status tracking
  #   status: "in_progress"    # pending | in_progress | completed | blocked
  #   priority: "high"         # high | medium | low
  #   created: "2025-01-09"    # YYYY-MM-DD format
  #   completed: null          # Set to YYYY-MM-DD when status becomes "completed"
  #   blocked_reason: null     # Required when status is "blocked" - explain blocker
  #
  #   # Dependency tracking - Reference: "maintain critical dependencies"
  #   depends_on: []           # List of task IDs this depends on (e.g., ["002-database-setup"])
  #   blocks: ["003-user-profile"]  # List of task IDs blocked by this
  #
  #   # Progressive disclosure - links to detailed context
  #   # WHY: Keep this file lightweight; full details are in task folder
  #   spec_file: ".specs/tasks/001-user-authentication/spec.yml"
  #   progress_file: ".specs/tasks/001-user-authentication/progress.yml"
  #   context_file: ".specs/tasks/001-user-authentication/context.md"

  # === EXAMPLE: BLOCKED TASK ===
  # Shows how to document a blocker

  # - id: "004-payment-integration"
  #   name: "payment-integration"
  #   status: "blocked"
  #   priority: "high"
  #   created: "2025-01-20"
  #   completed: null
  #   blocked_reason: "Waiting for Stripe API keys from DevOps team"
  #   depends_on: ["001-user-authentication"]  # Can't process payments without users
  #   blocks: ["005-subscription-management"]  # This blocks subscription feature
  #   spec_file: ".specs/tasks/004-payment-integration/spec.yml"
  #   progress_file: ".specs/tasks/004-payment-integration/progress.yml"
  #   context_file: ".specs/tasks/004-payment-integration/context.md"

  # === EXAMPLE: COMPLETED TASK ===
  # Shows completed state with timestamp

  # - id: "002-database-setup"
  #   name: "database-setup"
  #   status: "completed"
  #   priority: "critical"
  #   created: "2025-01-01"
  #   completed: "2025-01-05"  # Completion timestamp
  #   blocked_reason: null
  #   depends_on: []           # No dependencies - foundation task
  #   blocks: ["001-user-authentication", "004-payment-integration"]
  #   spec_file: ".specs/tasks/002-database-setup/spec.yml"
  #   progress_file: ".specs/tasks/002-database-setup/progress.yml"
  #   context_file: ".specs/tasks/002-database-setup/context.md"

  # === YOUR TASKS ===
  # Real tasks will be added here automatically by /cspec:task command
  # Format: NNN-feature-name (sequential numbered for creation order tracking)
