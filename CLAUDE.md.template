## Project Structure

{{PROJECT_STRUCTURE}}

**IMPORTANT:** When implementing features with `/plan` and `/implement`, all application code should be placed in the appropriate directories according to the structure above. If an app folder is specified in the Tech Stack section, all code should be organized within that folder.

## Critical Rules

<!-- Add project-specific constraints here -->
- ALWAYS run tests before committing
- NEVER commit directly to main branch
- READ spec files before implementing features
- UPDATE progress files during development
- RUN all commands inside Docker containers (see Commands section)

## Code Style

{{CODE_STYLE}}

## Workflow

### Starting New Feature
1. Run `/plan [feature-name]`
2. Review the generated spec in `.specs/active-task/spec.md`
3. Run `/implement` when ready to begin
4. Progress updates automatically after each phase

### Continuing Work
1. Run `/implement`
2. Claude will load context from `.specs/active-task/`
3. Continue from "Next Steps" in progress.md
4. Works for both fresh starts and resuming after breaks

### Before Stopping
1. Run `/checkpoint`
2. Commit work: `git add . && git commit -m "your message"`
3. Push if working with team: `git push`

### When Feature Complete
1. Run tests inside Docker (see Commands section)
2. Run `/archive` to move to completed
3. Create pull request if applicable

## Commands

### Environment

**Claude Code CLI runs on Linux (Debian-based)**, giving you access to all standard Linux commands:
- File operations: `ls`, `cat`, `grep`, `find`, `sed`, `awk`
- Git operations: `git status`, `git diff`, `git log`
- Package managers: `apt`, `apt-get` (for system packages)
- System tools: `curl`, `wget`, `jq`, `ps`, `top`
- And all other Debian/Linux utilities

### Docker Development (Primary)

**IMPORTANT:** All development commands must run inside Docker containers. Do NOT run commands directly on the host.

```bash
# Start all services
docker compose up

# Start with rebuild
docker compose up --build

# Start in detached mode (background)
docker compose up -d

# Stop all services
docker compose down

# Stop and remove volumes (clean state)
docker compose down -v

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# View logs for specific service
docker compose logs -f [service-name]

# Execute command in running container
docker compose exec [service-name] [command]
docker compose exec [service-name] bash  # Interactive shell

# Examples:
# docker compose exec backend pytest
# docker compose exec backend npm test
# docker compose exec backend python manage.py migrate
```

## Special Instructions

### Spec-Driven Development

This project uses spec-driven development with Claude Code. All features should:
1. Start with `/plan` to create specification
2. Have clear requirements in `spec.md`
3. Track progress in `progress.md`
4. Maintain resumption context in `context.md`

### Context Files

**Before implementing any feature, READ these files:**
- `.specs/active-task/spec.md` - What to build
- `.specs/active-task/progress.md` - Current status
- `.specs/active-task/context.md` - Full context for resumption

**After completing work or before breaks, UPDATE:**
- `.specs/active-task/progress.md` - Mark items complete, update next steps
- `.specs/active-task/context.md` - Add resumption notes

### Validation Checkpoints

**Before making changes:**
- [ ] Check if dependencies already exist (don't duplicate)
- [ ] Verify files/components exist before editing
- [ ] Reload files to see latest changes
- [ ] Check git status to understand current branch

**After making changes:**
- [ ] Verify code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Run type checks inside Docker: `docker compose exec [service-name] [type-check-cmd]`
- [ ] Run tests inside Docker: `docker compose exec [service-name] [test-cmd]`
- [ ] Update progress tracker
- [ ] Update context for resumption

## Dependencies

## Testing

**CRITICAL:** All tests must run inside Docker containers.

```bash
# Run all tests
docker compose exec [service-name] [test-command]

# Examples:
# docker compose exec backend pytest
# docker compose exec backend pytest -v
# docker compose exec backend npm test
# docker compose exec backend go test ./...
# docker compose exec backend cargo test

# Run with coverage
# docker compose exec backend pytest --cov=app tests/
# docker compose exec backend npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
# docker compose exec backend pytest tests/test_api.py
# docker compose exec backend npm test -- tests/api.test.ts
```
