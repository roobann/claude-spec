description: Create active-task from roadmap for a specific feature
---

Create an active task from the project roadmap and set up all necessary files for implementation.

**Usage:** `/cspec:task [feature-name]`

**Examples:**
- `/cspec:task user-authentication`
- `/cspec:task payment-integration`

## What This Does

1. Reads the project architecture and roadmap
2. Finds the specified feature in the roadmap
3. Checks if dependencies are met
4. Creates `.specs/active-task/` with all necessary files
5. Updates roadmap status to `in_progress`

## Process

### 1. Check for Project Architecture

**If `.specs/architecture.md` does NOT exist:**
```
❌ No project architecture found.

You need to create the project architecture first.

Run: /cspec:architect

This will create the master architecture and feature roadmap.
```

Stop and inform user.

**If `.specs/architecture.md` exists:** Proceed to Step 2.

### 2. Check for Active Task

**If `.specs/active-task/` exists and has files:**
```
⚠️ An active task already exists.

Current task: [feature-name from active-task]
Status: [status from progress.yml]

Options:
1. Archive current task first (recommended)
   Run: /cspec:archive
2. Overwrite current task (destructive - will lose progress)
3. Cancel
```

Wait for user choice.

**If `.specs/active-task/` is empty or doesn't exist:** Proceed to Step 3.

### 3. Read Project Context

Read these files in order:

**A) Read `.specs/architecture.md`**
- Understand project architecture
- Note technical decisions (ADRs)
- Identify patterns to follow
- Extract security requirements
- Note development standards

**B) Read `.specs/roadmap.yml`**
- Find all features
- Check feature statuses
- Identify dependencies

**C) Read `.specs/guidelines.md`** (if exists)
- Code organization rules
- Testing requirements
- Security checklist
- Performance budgets

**D) Read `CLAUDE.md`**
- App folder configuration
- Tech stack
- Project structure
- Existing conventions

### 4. Find Feature in Roadmap

**Look for feature by name in `roadmap.yml`:**

```yaml
features:
  - id: "F3"
    name: "user-authentication"  # Match this
    description: "..."
    priority: "critical"
    status: "not_started"
    dependencies: ["F1", "F2"]
```

**If feature NOT found in roadmap:**
```
❌ Feature "[feature-name]" not found in roadmap.

Available features:
Phase 1 - Foundation:
  - F1: database-setup (critical) - not_started
  - F2: project-config (critical) - not_started

Phase 2 - Core Features:
  - F3: user-authentication (high) - not_started
  - F4: user-profile (medium) - not_started

Run `/cspec:task [feature-name]` with one of the above feature names.

Or update .specs/roadmap.yml to add your feature.
```

Stop and inform user.

**If feature found:** Proceed to Step 5.

### 5. Check Dependencies

**If feature has dependencies:**

For each dependency ID, check its status in roadmap:
- If dependency status is `completed`: ✓ OK
- If dependency status is NOT `completed`: ⚠️ Blocker

**If any dependency is not completed:**
```
⚠️ Feature has unmet dependencies:

Feature: [feature-name] (F3)
Dependencies:
  - F1: database-setup (status: not_started) ❌
  - F2: project-config (status: completed) ✓

Recommendation: Complete F1 first.

Options:
1. Work on dependency first
   Run: /cspec:task database-setup
2. Continue anyway (may cause integration issues)
3. Cancel
```

Wait for user choice.

**If all dependencies met:** Proceed to Step 6.

### 6. Comprehensive Feature Planning

Use the Plan agent to design this specific feature based on project architecture.

**Launch Task tool with Plan subagent (very thorough):**

```
Design the feature: [feature-name]

**Context from Project:**
[Include relevant sections from architecture.md]

**Feature Details from Roadmap:**
- ID: [feature-id]
- Description: [description]
- Priority: [priority]
- Dependencies: [list of dependencies]
- Estimated Days: [days]

**Your Task:**
Create a detailed feature architecture that:

1. **Aligns with Project Architecture:**
   - Follow ADRs from project architecture
   - Use established patterns
   - Respect component boundaries
   - Follow security guidelines (OWASP)

2. **Feature Architecture:**
   - Component design
   - Data models (follow project domain model)
   - API endpoints (follow project API design)
   - Integration with existing features
   - Dependencies (external & internal)

3. **Implementation Plan:**
   - Break down into phases (Foundation, Core, Polish)
   - Create task list with dependencies
   - Assign domains (if multi-agent mode)
   - Identify risks

4. **Testing Strategy:**
   - Follow project testing approach
   - Unit test requirements
   - Integration test requirements
   - E2E test scenarios

5. **Security Checklist:**
   - OWASP mitigations for this feature
   - Authentication/authorization
   - Data protection

Provide comprehensive plan following the project's established architecture.
```

**Thoroughness Level:** very thorough

### 7. Create Active Task Directory

**Create directory:** `.specs/active-task/`

This will hold all files for the current feature.

### 8. Create Feature Architecture

**Create: `.specs/active-task/architecture.md`**

Use the template at `.specs/template/architecture.md.template` as the base.

**IMPORTANT modifications:**
- Add header linking to project architecture
- Reference project ADRs where applicable
- Note which project patterns are being followed
- Align with project security guidelines

**Header addition:**
```markdown
# Architecture: [Feature Name]

> **Project Architecture:** See `.specs/architecture.md` for system-wide design
> **Feature:** [Feature ID] from `.specs/roadmap.yml`

## Alignment with Project Architecture

**Referenced ADRs:**
- ADR-002: Uses PostgreSQL (project standard)
- ADR-003: Uses JWT authentication (project standard)

**Project Patterns:**
- Follows layered architecture
- Uses established error handling
- Follows project naming conventions

**Integration Points:**
- [Existing feature A]: [How this integrates]
- [Existing feature B]: [How this integrates]

---

[Rest of feature architecture...]
```

Fill in comprehensive feature architecture based on Step 6 planning.

### 9. Create Spec File

**Create: `.specs/active-task/spec.yml`**

Use the template at `.specs/template/spec.yml.template`.

**Fill in based on:**
- Feature details from roadmap
- Planning from Step 6
- Project architecture alignment
- Testing approach from project

**Key metadata to add:**
```yaml
metadata:
  feature_name: "[feature-name]"
  feature_id: "[F3]"  # From roadmap
  architecture_doc: "architecture.md"
  project_architecture: "../architecture.md"  # Link to project arch

  # From roadmap
  priority: "[priority from roadmap]"
  estimated_days: [days from roadmap]
  dependencies: [dependency IDs from roadmap]

  # From project architecture
  agent_coordination: [true/false from project]
  domains: [domains from roadmap]
  mcp_integration: [from project architecture]
```

### 10. Create Progress Tracker

**Create: `.specs/active-task/progress.yml`**

Use the template at `.specs/template/progress.yml.template`.

**Fill in based on:**
- Task breakdown from Step 6
- Testing approach from project
- Domain assignments (if multi-agent)

**Tasks should come from feature architecture Step 8.**

### 11. Create Context Files

**A) Create `.specs/active-task/context.yml`**

Use template at `.specs/template/context.yml.template`.

**Key additions:**
```yaml
metadata:
  feature_name: "[feature-name]"
  feature_id: "[F3]"
  architecture_doc: "architecture.md"
  project_architecture: "../architecture.md"
  status: "planning"

architecture:
  reference_doc: "architecture.md"
  project_reference: "../architecture.md"
  key_decisions:
    - "Follows ADR-002 for database"
    - "Follows ADR-003 for auth"
  integration_points:
    - system: "[Existing feature]"
      interaction: "[How we integrate]"
```

**B) Create `.specs/active-task/context.md`**

Use template at `.specs/template/context.md.template`.

**Add project context section:**
```markdown
## Project Context

**Project Architecture:** `.specs/architecture.md`
**This Feature:** [F3] in roadmap
**Dependencies:** [List completed dependencies]

**Alignment:**
- Uses [pattern] from project architecture
- Follows [ADR-X] for [decision]
- Integrates with [existing features]
```

### 12. Update Roadmap Status

**Update `.specs/roadmap.yml`:**

Find the feature and update its status:

```yaml
features:
  - id: "F3"
    name: "user-authentication"
    status: "in_progress"  # Changed from "not_started"
    started: "2025-01-08T14:30:00"  # Add timestamp
```

### 13. Present Task Summary

Show the user what was created:

```
✅ Task Created: [Feature Name]

📋 Feature Details:
- ID: [F3]
- Priority: [priority]
- Estimated: [X days]
- Dependencies: [list or "None"]

📐 Architecture Alignment:
- Follows project ADR-002 ([decision])
- Follows project ADR-003 ([decision])
- Integrates with: [existing features]

🎯 Implementation Plan:

  - T1: [task description]
  - T2: [task description]

Phase 2: [Phase name] ([Y tasks])
  - T3: [task description]
  - T4: [task description]

Phase 3: [Phase name] ([Z tasks])
  - T5: [task description]

Total: [N tasks] across [M phases]

📂 Files Created:
- .specs/active-task/architecture.md (feature design)
- .specs/active-task/spec.yml (requirements)
- .specs/active-task/progress.yml (task tracking)
- .specs/active-task/context.yml (metadata)
- .specs/active-task/context.md (human context)

📝 Roadmap Updated:
- Feature status: not_started → in_progress

---

📖 Next Steps:
1. Review architecture.md for detailed feature design
2. Run `/cspec:implement` to begin implementation

✅ Task ready for implementation!
```

**DO NOT start implementation.** Present the task and stop.

### 14. Complete Task Creation

Task is now ready. User can:
1. Review feature architecture
2. Run `/cspec:implement` to start work
3. Use `/cspec:archive` when complete

## Special Cases

**Case: Feature name contains spaces**
- Automatically convert to kebab-case
- "User Authentication" → "user-authentication"

**Case: Feature already in progress**
```
⚠️ Feature "[feature-name]" is already marked as in_progress.

This might mean:
1. You're resuming work (active-task exists)
2. Status wasn't updated after completion
3. Multiple people working on same feature

Check .specs/active-task/ to see current state.
```

**Case: Feature already completed**
```
✓ Feature "[feature-name]" is already completed.

Status: completed
Completed: [date]

To work on this feature again:
1. Create a new feature in roadmap (e.g., "user-authentication-v2")
2. Or update roadmap status to "not_started" to rework

Available not_started features:
[List other features]
```

**Case: No features in roadmap**
```
❌ No features found in roadmap.

The roadmap appears empty. Update .specs/roadmap.yml to add features.

Or run `/cspec:architect` to redesign the project architecture and roadmap.
```

## Tips

- **Check dependencies:** Always check if dependency features are complete
- **Follow project patterns:** Reference project architecture.md throughout
- **Stay aligned:** Feature architecture should fit project architecture
- **Use roadmap:** Roadmap is the source of truth for feature scope
- **One at a time:** Complete one feature before starting another

## Success Criteria

- Feature found in roadmap
- Dependencies checked (all completed or user accepted risk)
- Active-task directory created with all files
- Feature architecture aligns with project architecture
- All files reference project context
- Roadmap status updated to in_progress
- Ready for implementation with `/cspec:implement`
